Below are instructions for applying to work on Micro-Manager/Pycro-Manager through GSoC. The two routes to go in terms of project ideas: 1) Pick one of the ones on the [list we've provided ](https://github.com/henrypinkard/pycro-manager/blob/GSOC/Project_ideas.md) 2) Propose your own idea.

Before doing either, it is probably a good idea to familiarize yourself with the architecture and community surrounding Micro-Manager/Pycro-Manager. This can be done by: reading through the [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) and [Pycro-Manager](https://pycro-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation, browsing the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/micro-manager) where our community asks questions, and [downloading](https://micro-manager.org/Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release) and installing Micro-Manager and playing around with it (it comes with a simulated microscope so you don't need any hardware).

We also encourage you to reach out with any questions early to "info [at] photomics.ai". Meeting and discussing projects/ideas before submitting is a great way to craft a better application.



An ideal application will contain 5 things:
1. A **descriptive title** 
2. **Information about you**, including contact information.
3. Link to a **code contribution** you have made 
4. Information about your **proposed project**. This should be fairly detailed and include a **timeline**.
5. Information about **other commitments** that might affect your ability to work during the GSoC period. (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.) We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.


Sample Application Template:
# Pycro-Manager: The thing I want to do this summer

## About me
1. Full name, preferred name, github username
2. University / program / year / expected graduation date
3. Contact info (email, phone, etc.)
4. Time zone
5. Link to a resume (if you want)

## Code contribution
* Link to a pull request or code sample goes here.
  * It must represent your own work, although you can have help from developers to improve it.
  * It must be publicly visible.
  * You can link more than one if you want.

## Project information
1. Pycro-Manager
2. Project Abstract
3. Detailed description
4. Weekly timeline
   * The default schedule for GSoC is 12 weeks, either full-time or part-time. See [the GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for precise dates. This template assumes you'll be using those 12 weeks; if you're doing an alternate schedule you can adjust appropriately.
   * **Community Bonding**: List any prepwork you want to do before coding starts.
   * For each coding week below, list planned code deliverables. Break the project into weeks and estimate what you will have complete at the end of each one.  This schedule can be adjusted later if need be.

   * **Week 1** Note that usually even week 1's deliverables should include some code.
   * **Week 2**
   * **Week 3**
   * **Week 4**
   * **Week 5**
   * **Week 6** Midterm point. You need enough done at this point for your mentor to evaluate your progress and pass you.  Usually you want to be a bit more than half done.
   * **Week 7**
   * **Week 8**
   * **Week 9**
   * **Week 10**
   * **Week 11** you may want to try to "code freeze" in week 11 and complete any remaining tests/documentation in week 11-12.
   * **Week 12**
   * **Final week**:  This week you will be submitting your projects


## Other commitments
* List of any things that might affect your ability to work this summer.
   * List any exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc. We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.
